TODO:

Replace *rectangle* and *surface* with *sprite* for game objects

Add turn-based game logic:
	Player phase - waits for player input to end
	Enemy phase - enemy actions

Alternatively - initiative/speed based order?
	highest speed goes first regardless if player or computer
	what if more than 1 has same speed?
	what if speed changes?
	allow more than one action per turn depending on speed?


Idea for first level/map/dungeon/whatever:
	10 enemy groups
	each group 1-3 enemies (Orenians with swords)
	number of enemeies random each group
	higher numbers less likely
	after the 10 groups - 1 boss (orenian with hammer)
